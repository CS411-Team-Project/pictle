## Profile Avatars

When a user opens Pictle, he or she will be able to click on a profile icon that is located on the top right corner of the web application. The user will then be presented with a log-in screen to sign into their account. When logged in, the user may click on their avatar. They may change the appearance of their avatar through an option (via clicking). The user may regenerate a random avatar multiple times until they find an avatar to their liking.
