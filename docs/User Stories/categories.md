## Categories

As a web application game, it is desirable for Pictle to provide different categories or themes for its players. It is necessary to provide diversity in entertainment for users in order for them to enjoy the game. Pictle will have a sidemenu bar that will display different categories, such as album covers and movie posters, for the player to select from. When a player selects a category, a highly pixelated image from that category will be displayed. The user may then continue to play the game and input guesses.
