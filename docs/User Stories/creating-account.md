## Creating An Account

When a user opens Pictle, he or she will be able to click on a profile icon that is located on the top right corner of the web application. The user will then be presented with a log-in screen. The user may sign in using their Google account and authentication, or their preferred email account. The user will input their email address and password to sign in as an existing player or sign in as a new player. The user will be logged in and can access their profile page and information on Pictle.
