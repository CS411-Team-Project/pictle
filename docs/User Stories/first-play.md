## Playing Pictle for the First Time

A user will enter the web application site. The user will be greeted with the home page of Pictle. On the left side of the application website, the user will see a sidemenu icon, which will display categories for the user to choose from when clicked. When a player selects a category, a pixelated image associated with that category theme will be displayed. The user will also be shown the guessing interface that is located underneath the pixelated image. 

The user will input a guess for the pixelated image in a text-box located underneath and press the enter key to submit. The image will become less pixelated if the guess is incorrect. If the user guesses the correct title of the image, then he or she will be shown the image in full resolution, and the game comes to an end. If the user fails to guess the correct title of the image, then he or she will also be shown the image in full resolution, and the game comes to an end.
