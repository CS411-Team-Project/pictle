## Playing Pictle for the First Time

A user will enter the web application site. The user will be greeted with the home page of Pictle. On the left side of the application website, the user will see a sidemenu icon, which will display categories for the user to choose from when clicked. When a player selects a category, a pixelated image associated with that category theme will be displayed. The user will also be shown the guessing interface that is located underneath the pixelated image. 

### Guess UI Key
| Color & Description |
| Grey | This letter is not present in the string at all |
| Yellow | This letter is present in the string but it is not in the correct position |
| Green | This letter is present in the string and in the correct position |


The user will input a guess for the pixelated image and press the enter key to submit. The image will become less pixelated if the guess is incorrect. The guess interface colors in the letters based on their presence in the word solution. The user will continue to guess the correct title and/or name associated with the image, in which all letters of the word become green. If the user guesses the correct title of the image, then he or she will be shown the image in full resolution, and the game comes to an end. If the user fails to guess the correct title of the image, then he or she will also be shown the image in full resolution, and the game comes to an end.
