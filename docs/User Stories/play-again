## Play Again Feature

In Pictle, a user will be able to play a round or another game. Regardless of winning or losing a previous round, a user will be able to generate a new game. There will be a "play again" icon, which is located underneath the pixelated image and above the text-box for guesses. Once clicked, a new and different pixelated image is generated and displayed for the user.
